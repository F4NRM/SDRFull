//! The station's library of band plans: one `<name>.json` per plan in the
//! `bandplans` folder of the engine's config directory, and which of them the
//! station runs.
//!
//! The folder is the engine's, never a client's. A browser has no folder of the
//! station's to write to and a remote screen would write its own laptop's copy,
//! so a screen sends the *text* of a plan over the wire
//! ([`sdroxide_types::Command::ImportBandPlan`]) and the engine, which owns the
//! disk, checks it and writes it. Native, remote and web all take that road.
//!
//! Everything here takes the config directory as a parameter (`*_in`), which is
//! what lets the tests run without redirecting the process-wide one; the
//! functions without the suffix are the same thing on the real directory.
//!
//! ## What "the plan the station runs" means
//!
//! `config.toml` holds the name of the chosen plan ([`Settings::band_plan`]),
//! `None` for the built-in IARU tables — the default, and where "back to the
//! default" lands in one click. A name whose file has gone, or will not parse,
//! runs the built-in tables for that session with an alert and is left as it
//! is: it is somebody's document, and moving it aside would take it away at
//! the moment they need to fix it.
