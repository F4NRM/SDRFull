//! Meshtastic receive: what the operator asks the engine for and what it
//! reports back. Pure data + serde, shared by the native engine and the UI
//! (native + WASM). The demodulation and decoding live in the native
//! `sdroxide-meshtastic` crate, the same split as [`crate::sonde`].
//!
//! Like the sonde and HFDL lanes, this is not a radio mode: it rides its own
//! downconversion of the raw I/Q and the radio keeps its mode. The panel moves
//! the dial with the ordinary tune command, so the receive band list decides
//! whether it may; this lane never touches that list.
