//! The radiosonde (Vaisala RS41) decoder: the threading wrapper and the
//! wire-type mapping around `xng-mode-sonde`'s channel decoder. Native-only
//! (runs in the engine's audio-block loop); see [`controller`] for how it is
//! driven and [`tracks`] for how frames become per-sonde flight tracks.
//!
//! The demodulation *is* xng's: a 48 kS/s complex baseband lane centred on the
//! channel (the decoder's own channel rate, so it runs without a second
//! downconverter). This crate owns the worker thread, the bounded I/Q queue
//! and the per-serial track book.
