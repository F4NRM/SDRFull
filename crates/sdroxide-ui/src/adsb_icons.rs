//! The map's three symbols: an aircraft, an airport and a VOR.
//!
//! Each is a plain silhouette with nothing behind it: no disc, no tile, no
//! halo. The outlines were traced from the source pictures into triangles
//! (see `trace.rs`, which writes `data.rs`), so they stay sharp at any size
//! and ship no picture. The fill is a mesh; a hairline along the outline, drawn
//! by egui's anti-aliased path, takes the stair-steps off the edge.
//!
//! Every symbol is described in units (±1 about its centre, nose or top up)
//! and scaled by the caller's size; an aircraft is then turned to its track.
