//! NAVTEX against real SITOR-B recordings.
//!
//! Two fixtures:
//!
//! 1. `SITOR-B.wav` — the SITOR-B sample from sigidwiki (MONDOLFO RADIO
//!    broadcasting a coastal warning on 518 kHz), 8 kHz mono, the original
//!    fixture. Kept as a regression test: the decoder must still read it.
//!
//! 2. `Bermuda-48k.wav` — a 48 kHz mono recording of Bermuda Radio on 518 kHz
//!    (operator F4NRM, 2026-10-22, 180 s, 17 MB). This is the production
//!    rate the engine actually feeds the decoder at; it is the fixture that
//!    exposed the ratio-discriminator bug, which only manifested at 48 kHz.
//!
//! The reference text `Bermuda-48k.txt` is itself a lossy decode (it carries
//! ~15 character-level errors and a figures/letters garbled run), so the test
//! asserts message content — anchors and decoding metrics — not byte equality.
//! See AGENTS.md: "A passing test is evidence about the test, not about the
//! program."
