# Agent notes — SDR Oxide Brown

Technical and process rules for this fork. Kept in the repository so every
agent session starts from the same baseline. Personal working notes live in
`docs/internal/`.

## Project identity

SDR Oxide Brown is a fork of `sdroxide` tuned for 11 m CB, shortwave listening
and decoding. All three live in one program. Build name: **SDR Oxide Brown**.
Config directory: `~/.config/sdroxide-brown` (`org.sdroxide.sdroxide-brown`).
`CARGO_PKG_VERSION` stays plain (`2.2.0`). Executable name, macOS bundle id
and release asset names stay shared with upstream. Origin: `madmedicnl/sdroxide-brown`.

## Fork rules

- Contributions to code and ideas are always greatly appreciated, but
  **madmedicnl has the final say and can overrule** any decision.

- Work happens here. When a choice is between a ham workflow and a CB/listening
  one, this fork takes the CB/listening one.
- Never merge `upstream/main`. Upstream is behind us. Reading upstream is safe
  and encouraged (`git log`, `git show`, `git diff`). Taking a specific commit
  is done by hand, one commit at a time.
- Changes derived from upstream issues may be offered upstream as their own
  branch off `upstream/main`, one idea per PR. Purely fork-shaped work stays here.
- Two divergences are deliberate: Olivia's polarity (positive) and spoken alerts
  (speak regardless of window focus). Do not "fix" either by taking upstream's side.

  
- CTR on = the frequency is always in the middle With the CTR chip lit the red line is at the centre of the waterfall on every frame — wheel, pinch, keyboard zoom, pan, fit, mode or decoder change, every radio, the whole bandwidth, zoom in or out, fast or slow. No drift, no jitter, no off/on to re-centre. Modes keep their preset bandwidth; CTR only moves the line. Touching waterfall or zoom code: keep the ctr_zoom_sim tests in widgets/spectrum_view.rs green and add the gesture.
- Never perform a zoom correction on all radios at the same time. Each radio is different. A correction should not affect the other radios (example: PLUTO = 1 radio = 1 Interface radio).

## 11 m / CB and the FT modes: ask madmedicnl first

11 m is the core audience of this program, and the people there have no CAT,
no meters and no second chance: the sound card *is* the interface. Work that
touches the CB path directly is therefore **put to madmedicnl before a branch
or a PR exists**, not after it is written. In particular:

- the per-band transmit settings — the transmit band list, confirming it, what
  is and is not allowed on 11 m, the CB permission and its relation to the band
  tick;
- the USB sound card as a radio interface — how it is opened, buffered, paced
  and named, and anything that changes which device or which rate is used;
- the FT modes (FT8, FT4, FT2, JS8) and anything in the record or transmit
  audio chain under them.

No "improvement" and no tidy-up under those three without that conversation. A
fault may always be reported at once; the question is whether we fix it the way
proposed, not whether it exists.

Ease of use counts as part of the fix. A setting that costs more clicks, more
text or more choices than it is worth is a bad trade even when it is correct —
and the operator at the bench is the one who pays for it. Nobody is pushed to
the back of the queue for being the reason the program exists.


## F4NRM's areas (PR required, never straight to main)

F4NRM owns: decoders Bands plans, SSTV, DAB, NAVTEX, APRS, WFM, DSC, Olivia, RTTY, WEFAX,
FT8, RDS and backends HackRF, PlutoSDR. RSP1 is NOT on his list (bench receiver).
Confirmed on air by his radio group: WEFAX, DAB, SSTV, DSC, radio classic, aircraft.

Anything touching these — a fault fix, a wire change, a panel change — goes up as
a PR, never straight to `main`. No refactor or "improvement" without a report
against a specific fault.

Detachable windows are his too. When a change touches a panel, make it detachable
or stackable and add it to the Detachable page in Settings.

## House rules

- **Say it short.** Release notes: one line per change, max 60 lines. Replies
  are prose, not documents. No headings, no bulleted essays.
- **Not submissive, short, friendly.** Say the thing once and move on. No
  apologising for existing, no asking permission for work already agreed, no
  self-deprecation, no flattery. Friendly is warm and plain, not deferential.
- **No performance about honesty.** Correct a wrong statement plainly
  ("Correcting the first half of what I wrote above: …") and move on. Never
  frame the correction as a virtue — no "I would rather correct it than leave it
  standing", no "to be transparent", no announcing that one is being candid.
  The correction is the whole of it.
- **Ask a reporter one thing, not three.**
- **A measurement that disagrees with a report is the first suspect.** Check:
  visible? measures the right thing? existing number disagrees? something
  fighting the fix?
- **A passing test is evidence about the test.** Tolerances accommodating known
  faults are the fault.
- **A fix carries a test verified to fail on unfixed code.** Remove, watch fail,
  restore.
- **Read your own diff before pushing.** A script that inserts code can leave a
  duplicate attribute, a doc comment on the wrong item, or a stray blank line,
  and a green test run will not say so: the tests passed, the text around them
  was not looked at. Two of those reached a PR on 2026-11-04 and a reviewer
  found both.
- **Change a name or a format, then find its readers.** The writer is the easy
  half. `sstv-<ms>-2.png` broke `received_at` in another crate because that
  parses the timestamp back out of the name (review, 2026-11-04). Grep for
  every place that reads the thing, not only the one that writes it.
- **For anything drawn, render and look.** Numbers prove where ink is; only
  looking proves it's there.
- **Never claim fixed/shipped when it isn't.** "Needs feedback" is a request.
- **A control must never silently do nothing.** Name what's off, say why.
- **No paid service, no API key, no account. Ever.** Program works offline.
- **`git checkout --` destroys work.** Undo scratch patches with the patch.
- **`rg -n`, never `rg -rn`.**
- **Format what you touch.** No repo-wide `cargo fmt`. Fork-only files swept on
  arrival. Run rustfmt with `--config-path` or from repo root.
- **Commit messages:** short imperative subject, then the why.
- **CTR on = the frequency is always in the middle.** With the CTR chip lit the
  red line is at the centre of the waterfall on every frame: wheel, pinch,
  keyboard zoom, pan, fit, mode or decoder change; every radio, the whole
  bandwidth, zoom in or out, fast or slow. No drift, no jitter, no off/on to
  re-centre. Modes keep their preset bandwidth; CTR only moves the line. Touching
  waterfall or zoom code: keep the `ctr_zoom_sim` tests in
  `widgets/spectrum_view.rs` green and add the gesture you changed.
  - Web sessions: every fix and every new feature must also work in web sessions (browser client
connected to the web server), not only in the desktop app. Whatever needs to be stored is stored on the
server and reaches the client through the protocol (see "Persistence"). Everything is added to the web
server too, unless F4NRM says otherwise for that item. Check with
cargo check --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -p sdroxide-ui when wasm-reachable code changes.

## Every piece of interface text is translated

The interface speaks eleven languages: English (`en`), French (`fr`), Spanish
(`es`), German (`de`), Dutch (`nl`), Italian (`it`), Brazilian Portuguese
(`pt-BR`), Russian (`ru`), Turkish (`tr`), Japanese (`ja`) and Simplified
Chinese (`zh-CN`). **Any change that adds or edits text a person reads on
screen must add or update the message in all eleven languages in the same
change.** That covers labels, buttons, hover text, window titles, notes, status
lines, error messages shown to the operator and the names of values (`label()`
of an enum drawn on screen). "The next batch will carry the translations" is not
an option: a PR with English only is not finished, and it is not mergeable.

- Never write display text as a string literal in `crates/sdroxide-ui`. Use
  `tr!("some-id")`, or `tr!("some-id", n = 3)` for `{ $n }` placeables, or
  `tr!("some-id", "hint")` for an attribute.
- Add each message to every language with `tools/i18n_add.py` (JSON on stdin,
  one key per language, ids `area-words-of-the-text`). Keep `{ $name }`
  placeables as they are. Do not translate ids, file names, protocol names, mode
  names (FT8, SSTV…) or units.
- **The tool skips an id that already exists** — it reports `exists:` and moves
  on. Changing the wording of a message that is already there is therefore a
  line edit in every `sdroxide-ui/i18n/*/sdroxide.ftl` by hand, not a second run
  of the tool.
- A value an enum shows on screen gets an arm in
  `crates/sdroxide-ui/src/i18n/labels.rs`, not a `label()` call from the UI.
  `const`/`static` items cannot call `tr!`: keep the English there and translate
  when drawing.
- Run `cargo test -p sdroxide-ui --lib i18n` before pushing.
- Full rules and the Fluent syntax: `CLAUDE.md` and
  `crates/sdroxide-ui/i18n/README.md`.

**This list must match `CLAUDE.md`.** When a language is added or removed, `LANGUAGES` in
`crates/sdroxide-ui/src/i18n.rs` changes too (the web client embeds English only and
fetches the rest; a test checks the table against `i18n/`), and both
files are updated in the same change (see "Adding a language" in `CLAUDE.md`).

## Working autonomously

When the end goal is clear and boundaries are set, keep going, not ask.

A task is clear when all four can be written down:
1. End goal with definition of done (passing test, real capture, gate run)
2. Boundaries (crates, files, applicable rules)
3. How you will know it failed
4. What needs the bench (radio, off-air recording, another person)

Then work the queue end to end. Stop only for:
- F4NRM's areas, his panels, or the wire → branch, tests, PR, carry on
- A release or tag (never; operator and F4NRM cut those)
- Deleting branches, history, or work you didn't create
- A measurement needing a radio, recording, or another person
- A genuinely operator decision (product, licence, public reply, money)
- A check you cannot run (wasm target, platform build)

Keep the journal as you go: `docs/internal/AUTONOMY-JOURNAL.md`, newest first,
one entry per work item.

## Task tracking (Kanban + TODO)

- Every task started goes into `TODO.md` under **Now** (one line: what, why,
  where it came from) **and** the GitHub Projects board's **In Progress**
  before starting. Both must be updated — not just one.
- Every task finished moves in `TODO.md` to **Recently done** (today's date,
  one line) **and** to the board's **Done**; remove from In Progress. Both
  must be updated.
- Every task blocked goes under **Waiting on other people** in `TODO.md` with
  the single question, and to the board's **Blocked**.
- **Issues take priority over development.** Check open issues before starting
  new work. A report against an area is a new report about a specific fault.
- **Each task must name who added it and who owns it.** Format:
  `Item (added by X, owned by Y) — description.`
- The board is scripted (`gh project item-create` + `item-edit`). If the
  `project` scope is not granted, update `PROJECT-BOARD.md` itself and say so.
  Either way, `PROJECT-BOARD.md` must reflect the current state — it is the
  local mirror of the GitHub Projects board and must be updated for every
  task, not only when the script fails.
- Re-measurable numbers (crate version, PROTO_VERSION, open issues/PRs) must be
  kept current in TODO.md's state line and AGENTS.md.
- **A project made of several PRs updates `TODO.md` only once, at the end.**
  Each PR of the project is described on its own line (in the PR and in the
  hand-off), but none of them touches `TODO.md`. When **all the PRs of the
  project are merged**, a new PR made only for that updates `TODO.md` (and
  `PROJECT-BOARD.md`) for the whole project. This avoids `TODO.md` conflicts
  from one PR to the next. A change made of a single PR still updates `TODO.md`
  in its own PR, as above; the "before starting" and "finished" rules above
  apply to it unchanged.

## The wire

`PROTO_VERSION` and `VERSION_BYTE` live in `crates/sdroxide-proto/src/lib.rs`,
the only register kept current. Current on main: **256 / `0x4C`** (AGENTS.md
may lag; verify in code). Append last, always. A variant inserted mid-enum
shifts every discriminant below it. Two people work this repository — the
maintainer's agent and F4NRM's sessions — and `PROTO_VERSION` is one counter
between them.

- A wire change goes to a PR, never straight to `main`. This includes adding a
  `Command`, `ServerMsg`, `RadioEvent`, `Mode` or `Action` variant, a
  `DigiConfig`/`RadioConfig`/`NetworkConfig` field, or a `Mode` discriminant.
- `VERSION_BYTE` rides `PROTO_VERSION`. Bump it, or the client passes every
  test and is refused at the socket.
- A new wire variant needs a postcard round-trip test.
- `UiSettings` is not postcard-safe. The presentation-only wire type is
  `ClientScreen`. `InputSettings` is safe.
- `DigiConfig` and `RadioConfig` ride whole: never write one from a panel's
  stale copy.

## Build, test, and the gate

- `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` — the gate, must be silent.
- Test the crates you touched: `cargo test --release -p <crate>`. Reserve
  `--workspace` for release day.
- `sdroxide-radio`'s tests: name the binary (`cargo test -p sdroxide-radio
  --test cw_panadapter`).
- Browser build: `cargo check --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -p
  sdroxide-ui` when wasm-reachable code changes.
- Known flakes: `skim_window`, `sdroxide-pluto`'s `iiod_loopback`,
  `sdroxide`'s `icomnet_source`.
- A test that touches the machine is not a test: split decision from side effect.

## Releases

- No release happens by itself. No workflow carries a `schedule:` trigger.
  F4NRM cuts pre-releases; full release when he says everything is good.
- Release day: full gate green before the tag.
- Bump `Cargo.toml`, let cargo refresh `Cargo.lock`, check with `--locked`.
- Write changelog entry, tag `vX.Y.Z_brown`, push. Do not also dispatch.
- Never re-cut a tag. Bad tag → fourth-point tag (`v2.0.9.1_brown`).
- Install locally: `cargo build --release`, copy to `~/.cargo/bin/sdroxide`.

## Pull requests

A PR must be clean and mergeable: up to date with main, gate silent, touched
crates' tests passing, rustfmt clean on touched files, one complete thing per PR.

- F4NRM's PRs are never merged by us. He merges his own.
- Our own PRs are never merged by us. They sit until F4NRM reviews or merges.
- A sandboxed build needs `github.com/xiph/opus` and `media.xiph.org`.

## Hardware (bench)

- SDRplay RSP1 via `sdrplay_apiService`. Gain 20-59 dB, 0.01-2000 MHz.
- CRT SS9900v (11 m CB) as radio 1: USB audio, no CAT, keyed by VOX.
- Transmitting authorised on licence-free frequency — keep it short.
- Traps: rig's Mic/PCM levels separate; squelch defaults wide open; wireless
  mouse radiates into SS9900v.
- No Pluto, no HackRF on this network.

## Focus

No UI work unless a new mode needs a panel or something is very off. The
programme is the modes that did not finish in 2.1.0: 8PSK filter, wide PSK
banks, speeds that lose a word, MT63/Contestia/DominoEX variants. STANAG 4285
is finished. F4NRM's list (SSTV, DAB, NAVTEX, APRS, WFM, DSC, Olivia, RTTY,
WEFAX, FT8, RDS, HackRF, PlutoSDR) is his — report faults as PRs, never
unrequested tidy-ups. RSP1 is ours. DMR is out (patent). ATS Mini/DiamondRadio
are closed/unlicensed (research only). SDRuno look is parked.

## Where the work stands

- `main` at crate 2.2.0, PROTO_VERSION 262 (0x52). Latest release
  v2.2.3.6.2_brown (pre-release).
- Open issues: 8 (re-measured 2026-11-04). Open PRs: 1 — #434 public-SDR
  favourites.
- STANAG 4285 finished (Mark proved decode with video; coded payload not
  implemented — legal restriction). Olivia proven by user (RX+TX). Grey-line
  confirmed. S-meter still an issue.
- Live handovers: ALE (no real burst yet), STANAG 4285 (finished — Mark proved
  decode with video; coded payload intentionally not implemented, restricted by
  law in several countries), Olivia (proven on air RX+TX), CW keyer
  (built), SWL schedule sources (scoped), FST4W (do not ship).
- Confirmed on air: WEFAX, DAB, SSTV, DSC, HD Radio, Olivia.

## Current work

- WEFAX is ours now (the operator's call, 2026-11-03) and still goes up as a PR
  for a second pair of eyes. Merged that day: unique chart names, KiwiSDR tuning
  range, the auto-slant fit, the carrier-gone ending, the schedule links, and
  #435 — #432 merged a carrier rule the bench disproved within hours (1687/1687
  windows read "in band" over a real gap), so the corrected trigger followed.
  It has not fired on air yet: propagation went before the night half could run.
- Dynamic DNS merged (#425, 2026-11-03): the worker lives in the engine, the
  answer travels as `RadioEvent::DyndnsAnswer` / `ServerMsg::DyndnsAnswer`
  (PROTO_VERSION 260 → 262), the address is hidden and the token-in-clear note
  is in eleven languages.
- Public-SDR favourites (#434): a star per receiver and a MINE chip, kept by
  address in the settings.
- #427 SSTV starts on voice: ours after F4NRM made no move; the fix is to keep
  hunting for a VIS while drawing, so a false start cannot cost the real picture.
- #421 NB with Kiwi: the reporter came back — the blanker works on strong noise
  and not on weak, and its threshold is in samples, so it means something
  different at 20 kHz than at 768 kHz. A counter build was promised.


## History

`docs/internal/SESSIONS.md` is the record (2026-09-25 to 2026-10-24). Read it
when a rule needs its evidence. It is a record, not current state.
